      <p id="votingDes">Music companies and individuals must register with the Academy for music to
        be considered. Once entered, industry experts determine the recording is entered in the
        right category. Voting members then nominate eligible entries for General Field categories.
        The final voting ballots are distributed to voting members, and the recording with the most
        votes in each category are selected to win. </p>
